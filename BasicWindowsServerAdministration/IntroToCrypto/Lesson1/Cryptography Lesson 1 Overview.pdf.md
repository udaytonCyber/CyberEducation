LESSON OVERVIEW

Chapter 1: Symmetric Encryption

Lesson Description

Students  will  learn  about  a  variety  of  ciphers  used  throughout  history  (many  of  which  are
commonly  seen  in  CTF  challenges)  and  end  the  unit  learning  about  modern  computer-based
symmetric encryption through the AES algorithm.

☒  K-12

☒  Higher Education

☐  Adult /Workforce Development

Lesson Learning Outcomes:

Students will:
•  Understand the development of modern cryptographic systems in the context of the history

of cryptography.

•  Be able to encrypt and decrypt using basic substitution ciphers.
•  Understand how AES scrambles information in a reversible way to obfuscate the original data.
•  Be able to use OpenSSL to encrypt a file using AES.

Lesson Prerequisite Knowledge

No prerequisite knowledge is necessary. This lesson is designed to be accessible to beginners
with no prior knowledge of cryptography.

Prior Knowledge Alignments:

•  CompTIA Security+ Certification Objective 2.8

Required Materials:

The lab documents are designed to be used with a pre-configured virtual machine on the Ohio
Cyber Range, however, they can be implemented on any device running OpenSSL commands.

Instructional Materials

Chapter 1: Symmetric Encryption Presentation
Time Required: two 45-minute sessions

Description: Teacher takes students through a brief tour of the history of cryptography
touching on some alphabetic ciphers that are common in CTF competitions (Caesar cipher
through ENIGMA). This includes an introduction to AES encryption as a symmetric algorithm.

Student Textbook: Introduction to Ciphers and Cryptography
Time Required: Used throughout every module

Description: A student-facing text designed to provide asynchronous content for students that
aligns with the content in the presentations. The student text also has a variety of helpful
appendices.

Assessment Materials

Suggested Assessment Questions for Chapter 1
Time Required: If all ten questions were used, each assessment would be 15-25 minutes

Description: Ten suggested assessment questions: 5 auto-grade style questions (fill in the blank,
multiple choice, or select all style questions), and 5 open-ended response questions. A
suggested key is provided for each as well. The assessment questions are in plain text that an
instructor could copy and paste into any learning management system. Instructors can use
some, all, or none of the questions provided to suit their individual needs.

Labs

Lab 0: Introduction
Time Required: 10-15 minutes

Description: This document is meant to orient students as they begin working on digital labs. It
was designed for students who had little to no prior experience working in a digital lab
environment and explains the motivating purpose of a digital lab, how to get the most out of
the experience, and some basics around how to use a bash shell environment.

Lab 1: AES Encryption
Time Required: 20-30 minutes

Description: In this lab students will be introduced to the OpenSSL command line tool. Students
generate a symmetric key file and a text file that has content unique to them. Students use
their symmetric key file to perform AES encryption on their text file. Students verify that they
can decrypt their file as well. Students submit their symmetric key and their encrypted text file
to their teacher at the end of the lab.
