**Part 6: Creating Directories and Files**
=====================================================

One of the most common tasks in systems administration is manage files. Creating directories enables easy organization of files and access control.

### Creating New Directories
---------------------------

To create new directories, we can use the `mkdir` command.




mkdir /home/user/Documents/Work
mkdir /home/user/Documents/Taxes
mkdir /home/user/Documents/PartyPlanning




Creating Files
--------------

The `touch` command is used to create empty files.





touch /home/user/Documents/PartyPlanning/GiftIdeas.txt
touch /home/user/Documents/PartyPlanning/GuestList.txt
touch /home/user/Documents/PartyPlanning/PartyLocations.txt

touch ./Documents/Work/Budget.txt
touch ./Documents/Work/Payroll.txt
touch ./Documents/Work/EmployeeList.txt
touch ./Documents/Work/PartyBudget.txt




Managing Files
--------------

The tutorial introduces several commands used to manage files:
* `cp`: copy a file or directory (used with the `-r` option for recursive copying)
* `mv`: move or rename a file or directory
* `rm`: remove a file or directory

Examples of using these commands are provided, including copying and renaming files within directories.

Links
-----

The tutorial introduces symbolic links (`ln -s`) as shortcuts to files or directories.




ln -s /home/student/Documents/Work/Taxes/2019 /home/user/Documents/2019Tax




Changing Directories
-------------------

The `cd` command is used for changing directories.




cd /home/student/Documents

pwd




Overall, this tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of creating and managing files and directories in Linux.
